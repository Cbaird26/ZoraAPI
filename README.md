# ZoraAPI

[![CI](https://github.com/Cbaird26/ZoraAPI/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cbaird26/ZoraAPI/actions)

API library for the Zora consciousness system and MQGT-SCF (Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework) theory.

## Overview

ZoraAPI provides programmatic access to:
- Consciousness field computations
- Ethical field dynamics
- MQGT-SCF theoretical calculations
- Zora system interfaces

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run API server (if applicable)
python app.py
```

## Relationship to MQGT-SCF

This API layer builds on the canonical MQGT-SCF theory repository. For:
- **Core theory:** See [MQGT-SCF](https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF)
- **Theory papers:** See MQGT-SCF `papers/` directory
- **Experimental data:** See MQGT-SCF `data/` directory

## Documentation

- API documentation: (to be added)
- Theory background: [MQGT-SCF](https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF)
